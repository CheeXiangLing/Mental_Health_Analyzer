# Mental_Health_Analyzer
This app analyzes mental health-related text and classifies it into one of several psychological conditions. It supports both modern transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) and traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).

Among the transformer models, BERT delivers the best performance. For traditional models, Logistic Regression performs the best overall.
